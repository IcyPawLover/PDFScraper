# TODO:

- how to have global config files
    - Have a git repo that stores global configuration files?

- self updater
    - have the handlers check themselves and update themselves if needed
        - Once a script runs how to get it to reload the updated modules?  OR just have a separate setup/update script and then run the main script.

- maybe: add module checks for all helpers
